_Note: Although this library was hacked out of Android SDK and mainly intended to be used outside of Android, it seems that Android SDK itself does not have the vCard manipulation classes listed amongst the [public API](http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html). Therefore you may need this library even when you write an application just for Android._
